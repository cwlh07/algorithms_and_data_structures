Initially, I found it challenging to determine which approach was more suitable for different scenarios. However, through practice and analyzing the problem requirements, I realized that BFS can be more effective in situations where finding the shortest path is essential, while DFS is often better suited for exploring deeper structures or solving problems requiring exhaustive search.\n",

Their explanations clarified concepts I hadnâ€™t fully grasped before, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn from their expertise."
